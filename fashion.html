          <p>Fashion
            has a very long history. It began somewhere around Ancient Times, and
            has led to important inventions and evolved century after century until
            the present day.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The 20th century has seen, undoubtedly, the
            most radical evolution of fashion from one decade to the next. It’s
            during that time that the world’s greatest designers and big fashion
            houses saw the day, releasing countless iconic pieces and sparking
            trends to which fashion historians and professionals refer most today.
            With the rise of globalization, technology, social media, and new
            designers, the 21th century has also brought a rapid evolution in the
            fashion industry.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>All of the time periods are worth studying
            for anyone interested in fashion. However, in this article, we are
            going to cover the relatively recent fashion history from the 1900s
            until the present day. We will explain briefly what were the predominant
            styles of each decade, how they were born, and what were the major
            cultural movements and designers to popularize them. We hope this piece
            provides you with a comprehensive overview of the most important things
            you have to retain from the history of fashion, as this is a must-know
            for anyone who wants to work in this field. So, without further ado,
            let’s delve into the fascinating history of fashion through the
            decades.&nbsp;</p>
          <h2 id="the-history-of-fashion-through-the-decades" class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><strong>The
              History of Fashion Through The
              Decades</strong></h2>
          <h3 id="1900s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1900s </strong></h3>
          <p>The main fashion trend of the first decade of the 20th century was the<strong> S-shape
              silhouette</strong>
            that pushed the chest forward and the hips back. However, towards the
            end of the decade, women embraced a more natural silhouette.</p>
          <p>Day
            dresses would cover the body from the neck to the floor and had long
            sleeves. Evening dresses largely followed the same silhouette. Though
            these gowns were more revealing with very low décolletage and short
            sleeves, which often called for long gloves.</p>
          <p>When <strong>sports</strong>
            broke into fashion at the beginning of the 20th century, such as golf,
            tennis, cycling, and motoring that were practiced by men and women, they
            all inspired their own clothing styles.</p>

          <h3 id="1910s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1910s</strong></h3>
          <p>The
            second decade of the 20th century began with a shift from corsetry and
            S-shape silhouettes to more natural forms. Designers such as<strong> Paul Poiret, Lucile (Lady
              Duff Gordon), Georges Doeuillet, and Jacques Doucet </strong>revolutionized
            fashion in that regard. They were in favor of less restrictive clothes.
            And designed pieces that defined the more natural contours of the
            female form. That’s how <strong>empire dresses,</strong> which were popular at the beginning
            of the 19th century came back into fashion.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>An important development at the beginning of the decade was the rise of
            <strong>Orientalism</strong> with The Ballets Russes which performed <em>Schéhérazade</em>
            (a ballet based on One Thousand and One Nights) in Paris in 1910.
            Influenced by this movement, Paul Poiret introduced “harem” pantaloons
            and The Fancy Dress costume in 1911. The same year, he introduced the
            famous <strong>“hobble skirt”</strong>. But it soon proved to be near impossible to move in
            and thus became unpopular.
          </p>
          <p>The
            outbreak of World War I pushed the need for practicality even more.
            Women worked in munitions factories for the war effort, so they began to
            wear <strong>utilitarian clothing</strong>.</p>

          <h3 id="1920s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1920s</strong></h3>
          <p>The
            1920s are often remembered as the Age of glitz, jazz, and glamour.
            However, despite this, the twenties were also marked by simplicity and
            practicality. Because after the end of the Great War, women wanted more
            minimalistic and comfortable clothing. Which meant no more corsets,
            crinolines, bustle skirts, and other pieces characteristic of the
            Victorian era.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The new popular fashion trend was <strong>“the flapper look”</strong>,
            also know as “la garçonne”, boyish look. The flapper dress was
            characterized by a dropped waist, hemlines that rose to just below the
            knee, and simplicity in construction. The androgynous silhouette
            introduced a new notion of a feminine look. And was mainly popularized
            by Coco Chanel (we wrote about Coco Chanel history <a
              href="https://glamobserver.com/history-of-designers-gabrielle-coco-chanel/" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Another trend that dominated the 1920s was Jeanne Lanvin’s more romantic version of a
            feminine dress – the <strong>“Robe de style”</strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>Sportswear</strong>
            became even more acceptable to wear for women during this decade. Elsa
            Schiaparelli, Coco Chanel, and Jean Patou are regarded as the main
            designers to revolutionize women’s sportswear.</p>
          <p>The styles of the
            20s contributed to the “democratization” of fashion. Any woman could
            achieve a fashionable look. With more simple clothes, made with less
            expensive materials and easy to put on, more women could afford to dress
            well for every occasion.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Women’s
            fashion softly transitioned from the boyish look of the previous decade
            into the feminine silhouette of the early thirties. One of the most
            important trends was the <strong>bias cut</strong>, a technique that allows the fabric to
            drape over the body (see picture below).&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In
            addition, the cinema of the 30s and specifically Hollywood had a great
            impact on fashion. Movie stars like Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, and
            Bette Davis, among others, became some of the first Hollywood style
            icons.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3 id="1940s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1940s</strong></h3>
          <p>With
            the outbreak of World War II that led to a shortage of materials and
            rationing, fashion became practical with uniforms for men and women who
            served during the war, and <strong>utility clothing </strong>for other citizens. A common look
            had padded shoulders, cinched waist, and hemlines below the knee.</p>
          <p>One of the results of rationing was the <strong>invention of the bikini in 1946 </strong>by
            Jacques Heim (it was called “Atome”, suggesting that the bikini was as
            small as an atom) and Louis Reard (he was inspired by an atoll in the
            Marshall Islands that the United States had chosen to target its atomic
            bombs) “The Atome” and “The Bikini” were seen by both designers as
            metaphors for the explosion, which was the exact effect the bikini had
            on fashion and society in the 40s.</p>
          <p>After the war, Christian Dior (we covered Christian Dior history <a
              href="https://glamobserver.com/history-of-designers-christian-dior/" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>) introduced his
            iconic<strong> “New Look” in 1947</strong>,
            which was a groundbreaking design, much ahead of its time with the
            cinched-in waist and embodied full skirt. The fashion world had never
            seen such elaborate designs, using an abundance of fabric to create his
            lavish, elegant look to celebrate women; it was unheard of to use so
            much fabric in a time pre-war was full of rationing. But Dior wanted to
            celebrate life after the war and embrace women’s beauty and feminity
            encouraging joy and extravagance again.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3 id="1950s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1950s</strong></h3>
          <p>After
            years of war marked by rationing and rather strict and sober
            silhouettes, women had the desire to dress up and look stylish. And so,
            the 50s were characterized by feminine and elegant silhouettes, with
            cinched waists and full dresses and skirts.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Dior’s ”New
            Look” remained popular. However, the decade saw the emergence of other
            silhouettes as well, which in contrast were straighter and slimmer. A
            good example is <strong><a href="https://glamobserver.com/the-history-and-evolution-of-balenciaga/"
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Cristobal Balenciaga’s
              </a>“Sack dress” from 1957</strong>.
            This fashion design shocked the world, as he pioneered never before
            seen silhouettes in women’s fashion. He went in a completely different
            direction than Dior with the broad shoulders and box shapes of the Sack
            Dress. Contrary to Dior, Balenciaga gave volume to his dresses and
            skirts through the skillful manipulation of the fabric. While Dior had
            to rely on built-in corsetry and layered underskirts to achieve volume.
            Another difference between them is the weight: the Balenciaga gown is
            only 2.2 pounds. While the Dior garment weighs over 9 pounds.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Another designer who rivaled the Dior New Look was <strong>Coco Chanel</strong>. She reopened
            her business in 1954 and reintroduced her signature<strong> slim look </strong>with boxy
            jackets and straight skirts.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As
            you can see, the 50s brought Dior, Balenciaga, and Chanel as the
            leaders of Paris couture. However, the way they revolutionized women’s
            fashion is radically different.</p>

          <h3 id="1960s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1960s</strong></h3>
          <p>In the early years of the decade, fashion continued along the lines of the 1950s.
            <strong>First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy</strong>
            was the style icon. And Hubert de Givenchy and Cristobal Balenciaga
            were the major designers to popularize the feminine look still in
            fashion.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>The mid of the decade was known as the <strong>“Swinging Sixties”</strong> – a cultural
            phenomenon focusing on youth, spotlighting music and fashion. <strong>Mary Quant, André
              Courrèges, Pierre Cardin, and Paco Rabanne</strong>
            were among the first designers to understand the needs of modern women
            by creating clothes that felt liberating, daring, and fun while staying
            practical, and often they questioned conventional gender norms.</p>
          <h6
            id="the-first-revolutionary-design-was-the-miniskirt-whose-invention-is-credited-to-both-mary-quant-and-andre-courreges"
            class="wp-block-heading">The first revolutionary design was the <strong>miniskirt</strong>
            whose invention is credited to both Mary Quant and André Courrèges.</h6>
          <p>Mary Quant made her contribution to the sexual liberation of women with trousers and
            hotpants, as did <a href="https://glamobserver.com/history-of-designers-yves-saint-laurent/" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Yves Saint
              Laurent</a>
            when he invented the first tuxedo for women. With the popularity of
            androgynous looks, even the models changed. The era’s most high-profile
            model was <strong>Twiggy</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>New <strong>innovative materials</strong>
            were introduced, such as acrylics, polyesters, PVC (polyvinyl
            chloride), vinyl, lycra, and metallics. Bright colors began replacing
            the sober palette of the previous decades.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>It was the era of <strong>futuristic fashion</strong>,
            as designers were inspired by space travel and technology. As we can
            see with Courrèges’s “Moon boots”, and Rabanne’s “12 unwearable dresses
            collection from 1966.</p>
          <p>We also have to cite Pierre Cardin, who took inspiration from<strong> Pop Art and Op Art
            </strong>to
            experiment with motifs, geometry, and colors. See his “Egg carton
            dress” from his landmark 1968 “Cosmocorps” collection, and the “Bubble
            dress”. Courrèges also had a passion for exploring geometry and wanted
            to reflect his passion for architecture in his clothes. The designer cut
            his garments in squares, triangles, and trapezoids, all of which were
            considered ingenious and striking shapes, and questioned the notion of
            traditional feminity after the 50s – a time when dominated the use of
            the perfect hourglass silhouette.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>By the late 1960s, fashion began transitioning towards the <strong>hippie aesthetic
            </strong>which
            was a way of rejecting mainstream fashion. Yes, although it’s the 70s
            that are associated with the hippie look, it actually appeared in the
            late 60s.</p>

          <h3 id="1970s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1970s</strong></h3>
          <p>The decade saw a wide range of popular fashions. Of course, the hippie style was in vogue,
            particularly with the <strong>prairie dresses</strong>
            that were incorporated into high fashion collections. Patchwork,
            crochet and knitting, embroidery and synthetic materials for which the
            70s became known as the “Polyester decade” were common fashion trends.</p>
          <p>Later in the decade, the hippie style left room for the glamorous looks of <strong>“the disco
              era”</strong> with designer Halston up front.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In the early- to mid-seventies, some designers responded to the sexual freedom of women. For
            example, in 1971, <strong>Yves Saint Laurent</strong> launched a 1940s-inspired collection
            <strong>“Libération”</strong>, and <strong>Diane Von Furstenberg</strong> released her
            timeless <strong>“Wrap dress”</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>Finally,
            sportswear made, once again like in the early decades of the 20th
            century, its entry into women’s fashion. It was mostly popularized by <strong>Norma
              Kamali</strong> with her iconic “Sleeping bag coat”, sweats, and a “Parachute” collection of
            dresses and jumpsuits.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The
            80s was a decade of cultural transformation and the expression of
            individuality. People were no longer afraid to be who they were, and
            that mentality was reflected in their fashion choices. They like
            extravagant styles, bold colors, and accessories were a must. Neon
            clothes and jumpsuits were a thing, too. Christian Lacroix, Jean-Paul
            Gaultier, Versace, and Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel, among other fashion
            designers, responded to that trend.&nbsp;</p>

            off-the-shoulder sweatshirts, sport shorts, spandex, leggings, leg
            warmers, and headbands.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Music in the 1980s had a great influence on fashion: <strong>pop music</strong> (big
            hairstyles, glitter makeup, lots of jewelry);<strong> punk</strong>
            (tartan clothing, Doc Martens, leather, and fishnet (Vivienne Westwood
            opened the decade with stylish sportswear and the soft “New Romantics”
            style with her 1981 “Pirate” collection) and <strong>Hip Hop</strong> (loose fitting jeans,
            sneakers, etc.).</p>
          <p>As
            more women began to work and occupy high-level positions, they were in
            need of a new wardrobe. That’s how jackets with padded shoulders (see
            suits by Emanuel Ungaro and Thierry Mugler), bold accessories, and high
            heels made their entry. Princess Diana, Nancy Reagan, and Margaret
            Thatcher all popularized the fashion trend of <strong>“power suits”</strong>.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, American designers such as <strong>Perry Ellis and Ralph Lauren</strong>
            were turning to a more classic and casual style with the <strong>“preppy look”</strong>.
            Which was influenced by traditional Ivy League and Seven Sisters Style,
            as well as the dress of early&nbsp; 20th century British aristocrats.</p>
          <p>Finally, a shocking new type of fashion emerged from <strong>Japan </strong>and differed from
            the Western styles. Designers such as <strong>Comme des Garçons’ Rei Kawakubo and Yohji
              Yamamoto</strong> employed deconstruction, exaggerated proportions, and presented black as
            the new <em>it</em> color.</p>

          <p>The beginning of the 1990s was the peak of the <strong>Supermodel era</strong>.
            Among the most celebrated were Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Naomi
            Campbell, and Christy Turlington, known as “the original supermodels”.</p>
          <p>The <strong>sportswear</strong>
            looks of the eighties continued into the early nineties with biker
            shorts, leggings, Keds, and oversized sweatshirts continuing to be
            favorite choices for young women.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Then, fashion towards a more casual style of dressing and <strong>minimalism</strong>.
            The slip dress was the biggest fashion trend. The supermodels were
            replaced by the “heroin chic” models, a type of model epitomized by Kate
            Moss.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The three main subcultures of the 90s were <strong>Grunge fashion </strong>pioneered by Marc
            Jacobs and Alexander McQueen, (loose-fitting, worn-out jeans, flannel shirts, Doc Martens, and
            chunky boots) <strong>the preppy style</strong>, (oversized shirts, high-waisted jeans, plaid
            mini-skirts) and <strong>Punk</strong>
            (black leather jackets, ripped jeans, choker necklaces). In addition,
            women wore overalls, swirl patterns, leopard print, scrunchies,
            bandanas, crop tops, tie-dye…</p>
          <p>The music and film industry with
            Destiny’s child, The Spice Girls, Clueless, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,
            Britney Spears…influenced these popular fashion trends of the 90s.</p>

          <h3 id="2000s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2000s</strong></h3>
          <p>Fashion at the rise of the 21th century was similar to the one in the late 1990s. But due to
            globalization<strong> </strong>and the rise of <strong>fast fashion</strong>,
            when affordable clothes inspired by runway designs can now be found in
            department stores like Mervyn’s, J.C. Penney, and Macy’s) fashion trends
            became even more widespread. Moreover, celebrities and characters from
            TV shows such as <em>The OC, One Tree Hill, and Gossip Girl </em>were <em>the</em> style icons
            of the decade and influenced many people.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Fashion was also marked by the rapid development of<strong> technology</strong>, which
            translated into fashion. The <em>Matrix </em>movie
            in particular inspired a few designers like Balenciaga, Calvin Klein,
            and Yves Saint Laurent to use almost exclusively black for their Fall
            2001 collections.</p>
          <p>After the tragic events of 9/11, fashion
            returned to conservatism, casual clothing, and leisurewear, and the most
            dominant item was <strong>jeans</strong>. Its style evolved throughout
            the years: low-rise, bell-bottom pants, skinny, ripped, or otherwise
            worn jeans. They became an acceptable item to wear in nearly all
            occasions. Sneakers were an important part of the look, especially retro
            Nike Air Jordan’s and Adidas Yeezys. Platform heels and Ugg boots were
            also in fashion. Another trendy piece was the <strong>tracksuit</strong>, worn by the likes of
            Jennifer Lopez, Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and TV show actresses.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The predominant looks of the decade were the <strong>bohemian</strong> (or boho) look that
            replaced the grunge look of the nineties (vintage and handmade clothing was in vogue),<strong>
              hip-hop, streetwear, Y2K, scene, emo, and athleisurewear</strong>. These different
            subcultures of the 2000s influenced fashion in different ways.</p>

          <h3 id="2010s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2010s</strong></h3>
          <p>Throughout
            the 2010s, many women wore workout gear not just for sport, but as
            casual everyday wear. This style that emerged in the previous decade
            with the tracksuit and came to be known as athleisure continued during
            the 2010s.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Although before it was celebrities who partly dictated the trends, in the 2010s, it was
            fashion <strong>bloggers and influencers</strong> due to the rise of social media.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>There was also a <strong>return to maximalism</strong>
            from the 1980s. A pivotal moment was in 2015 when Alessandro Michele
            took over as creative director of Gucci (we talked about the history of
            Gucci <a href="https://glamobserver.com/the-history-of-gucci/" target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>)
            and brought bright colors and bold textures to the collections. Other
            designers supported this trend, like Demna Gvasalia for Balenciaga and
            Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Finally, besides the
            trends themselves, the 2010s brought a bigger focus on sustainability
            issues. Both consumers and companies began to speak about the impact of
            fashion on the environment, and the working conditions of factory
            workers.</p>
          <h3 id="2020s" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2020s</strong></h3>
          <p>The outbreak of Covid had a long-lasting impact on fashion. People adopted cozy and practical
            clothing, and <strong>activewear</strong> became a fashion trend again. The value of comfort
            persisted after the lockdown, so the <strong>minimalism</strong>
            of the 90s resurfaced. So far, the 2020s also brought back trends
            characteristic of other decades, like mini dresses and skirts from the
            60s, and the <strong>Y2K</strong> trend from the 2000s. Let’s see what the next years of the
            decade will bring.</p>
          <p>This
            is it for now for the brief fashion history through the decades. We
            went through the most important fashion trends, pieces, subcultures and
            designers you need to know. And what’s your favorite decade in fashion?

        Evolution is where we delve into history with a focus on typographical and color aesthetics. Our articles are
        crafted with two distinct themes: the Historical Theme, reflecting typographical styles from the 16th to the
        19th centuries, and the Antique Theme, which embraces the transition from early 20th-century print aesthetics to
        modern color schemes.

        As you explore our content, you'll notice subtle typographical changes and color palettes inspired by each
        theme. The metadata integrated throughout our articles further enhances the visual experience, highlighting key
        elements and providing context.
