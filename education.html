        education across three generations and 42 years in a Maya community</title>
      <div class="hlFld-Abstract">
        <h2 class="section-heading-2" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p class="last">Analyzing three sets of video data collected in one Maya community, we examined apprenticeship
          and learning of backstrap loom weaving over three generations spanning the years 1970 to 2012. Like many
          cultural groups, the Maya of Chiapas are experiencing rapid sociodemographic shifts. Three generations of
          girls (N = 134) were observed at their looms: in the 1970 subsistence economy; in the transition to a
          commercial economy in the 1990s; and in 2012, when the commercial economy required formal education.
          Multilevel models showed that intergenerational sociodemographic change - increased time in school, greater
          involvement in the money economy, and decreased family size - changed weaving apprenticeship, which, in
          turn, was related to changes in characteristics of learners. In 2012, weaving learners received more
          explanations, praise, and body instruction from their teachers. Learners, in turn, asked more questions.
          However, these changes came at a cost - the gradual loss of weaving as an everyday subsistence practice and
          art form. Tracing intergenerational change over three generations, this study makes a unique contribution to
          an understanding of cultural evolution.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading-2" id="d1e153">Introduction: the evolution of cultural transmission in a real-world
          setting</h2>
        <p>In this study, we use the case of the apprenticeship of Maya weaving, a central cultural practice with an
          ancient cultural tool, the backstrap loom, to empirically examine processes of cultural change, i.e., cultural
          evolution. Our methodology allows us to explore how ecological change produces historical change in cultural
          transmission, specifically, the intergenerational transmission of backstrap-loom weaving. We term the
          interactive teaching practices that produce intergenerational transmission of a skill the “proximal learning
          environment”. Intergenerational transmission is central to cultural continuity. It is also central to cultural
          evolution. When the interactive teaching practices central to cultural transmission change, cultural evolution
          takes place. Our study focuses on intergenerational change in the transmission of skill with a cultural tool -
          the backstrap loom.</p>
        <p>The transmission of weaving know-how in three successive generational cohorts over a 42-year-period of rapid
          ecological change in a Zinacantec Maya community in Chiapas, Mexico formed a natural experiment to elucidate
          processes of cultural evolution through empirical study. More concretely, we explore the ways that ecological
          change at the macro-level of the community are reflected in the sociodemographic characteristics of
          individuals; these sociodemographic characteristics are components of the “distal learning environment”. This
          distal learning environment is then reflected at the micro-level of the proximal learning environment, which
          in turn influences the behavior of individual learners. The comprehensive theoretical claim of this research
          is that (1) changes in a community ecology are reflected in shifting sociodemographic characteristics of
          community residents. These sociodemographic characteristics constitute the distal learning environment for the
          next generation. (2) Shifts in the distal learning environment are reflected in corresponding adaptations in
          proximal learning environments, interactions between learner and teacher. (3) These, in turn, foster changes
          in learner behavior, that is, altered developmental pathways. In principle, although not in detail, this
          conception resembles Bronfenbrenner’s (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0014" href="#"
              data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                class="off-screen">Citation</span>1977</a></span>) ecological systems theory with development affected
          by multiple levels going from the developing child’s immediate environment outward to the broader environment.
        </p>
        <p>We studied the first generational cohort of Zinacantec Maya girls learning to weave in 1970 (Childs &amp;
          Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT820268" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
              data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1980</a></span>); we
          studied the second generational cohort in the early 1990s (Greenfield et al., <span
            class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0006" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
              data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2003</a></span>). In
          this article we introduce the third generational cohort, studied in 2012. The longitudinal study of three
          generations of learners, all observed in the same age range, provides a unique cross-cohort comparative design
          in comparative development. Most important to the research design of our natural experiment, each successive
          generation grew up in a different ecology, an environment with unique sociodemographic features. Therefore, we
          can isolate and differentiate the sociodemographic mechanisms that produced shifts in learning processes from
          Generation 1 to Generation 2 and from Generation 2 to Generation 3. By tracing intergenerational change in a
          key practice of cultural transmission in three different ecologies, over such an extended time span, we are in
          the position of making a unique contribution to a data-based understanding of cultural evolution.</p>
        <p>Cross-sectional designs comparing different participants in different ecologies have provided valuable
          information suggesting behavioral effects of social change in Maya communities in Chiapas, Mexico
          (Esteban-Guitart et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0025" href="#"
              data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span

                class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>). Our approach has been the longitudinal study of a
          single village (Greenfield et al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0006" href="#"
              data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span

              data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>); this
          is a more direct design for studying the effects of social change on culture and human development
          (Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
              data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). A
          longitudinal research design allows the empirical study of cultural evolution, an intrinsically longitudinal
          process, in a way that cross-sectional designs do not.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="d1e186">Social change from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft: Implications for
            cultural transmission</h3>
          <p>Like many cultural groups, the Maya of Chiapas are experiencing rapid socio-economic and demographic shifts
            in the context of globalization. These macro-level shifts involve a number of interrelated and synergistic
            shifts: the development of a commercial economy, urbanization, the expansion of formal education, and the
            augmented use of technology. We summarize this suite of interrelated characteristics with Tönnies’ (1957)
            term <i>Gesellschaft.</i> In all of these areas, the Zinacantec Maya community of Nabenchauk has moved in
            the Gesellschaft direction from a relatively isolated community based on subsistence activities such as corn
            agriculture and weaving. Using Tönnies’ term, we summarize these interrelated characteristics with the term
            <i>Gemeinschaft</i>.
          </p>
          <p>Another characteristic not mentioned by Tönnies, but that is part of a subsistence agricultural economy, is
            large family size (Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#"
                data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                  class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>). In a Gemeinschaft ecology, more children are
            adaptive because families need their assistance in subsistence tasks (Kagitcibasi &amp; Ataca, <span
              class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0040" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>;
            Lancy, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0042" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>). In
            contrast, smaller families are adaptive in <i>Gesellschaft</i> environments where children cost money
            (Greenfield, 2004).</p>
          <p>Besides large family size, Gemeinschaft ecologies have relatively high infant and child mortality rates,
            whereas Gesellschaft ecologies have relatively low infant and child mortality rates. This is in part because
            of technological developments, notably medical care and a supply of purified water. In the current article
            we document intergenerational reductions in family size and infant/child mortality as part of Nabenchauk’s
            transition to a more Gesellschaft ecology. As will be seen, smaller families are an element of the distal
            learning environment that has implications for the intergenerational transmission of backstrap-loom weaving.
          </p>
          <p>In the present study, we will assess how each of these community-level shifts in the Gesellschaft direction
            plays out in our three cohorts of participants, studied over a period of 42 years. We will also test their
            predicted interrelationship through correlational analysis. Interrelated ecological conditions produce what
            Rogoff and colleagues call “constellations of cultural practices” (Rogoff et&nbsp;al., <span
              class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0060" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>).
          </p>
          <p>The comprehensive theoretical claim of this research is that interrelated changes in a community’s
            sociodemographic characteristics, the distal learning environment, will lead to corresponding adaptations in
            proximal learning environments, the cultural practice of teaching girls how to weave on a backstrap loom.
            Altered teaching practices will, in turn, foster altered developmental pathways, shifts in learner behavior.
            An important implication is that learning environments are adapted to shifting macro conditions.</p>
          <p>In our study of the first two generations, we documented the influence of the economic transition from
            subsistence to commerce on the intergenerational transmission of backstrap-loom weaving in the Zinacantec
            Maya community of Nabenchauk. Those generations spanned the period from 1970 to 1993 (Greenfield et al.,
            <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0006" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2003</a></span>). We
            found that the main effect of participating in a commercial economy on the cultural transmission of
            backstrap-loom weaving was to make the learning process a more independent one, as working mothers were
            unavailable to help daughters.
          </p>
          <p class="last">The current article adds the study of weaving apprenticeship in the third generation, 21 years
            later. This is a longitudinal study of a community. By adding the study of weaving apprenticeship in the
            third generation, 21 years later, we extend the longitudinal reach of our community study of the evolution
            of cultural transmission, and we explore the role of two new ecological factors: first, the expansion of

          <p>Nabenchauk added remote junior high school education (<i>telesecundaria</i>) to elementary school between
            data collection for Generations 1 and 2. Between data collection for Generations 2 and 3, two high schools
            were established in neighboring Zinacantec communities (Manago, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a

                data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>). In that same period, a
            federal program called Oportunidades began paying poor Zinacantec families 1500 pesos (US$130) every two
            months for each child in high school and 800 pesos (US$70) for each child in junior high school (Manago,

            Thus for Generation 3, secondary education through high school became possible. Most important, elementary
            school graduation became normative for girls for the first time.

          <p class="last">How does this influence work in concert with another new Gesellschaft factor, mobile
            technology, to produce change in the informal educational process of learning to weave? By 2012, the year we
            collected third-generation data, cell service was newly available in the county seat of Zinacantan Center
            (Manago &amp; Pacheco, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0050" href="#"

            Does more extended school experience, in combination with mobile technologies, alter or undercut the
            transmission of weaving to the next generation? These were central questions for our study.

          <p>Intergenerational transmission takes place at the level of the proximal learning environment. In this
            study, the proximal learning environment consists of practices used to teach backstrap-loom weaving.
            Cultural transmission and the role of teaching is a major focus in the study of cultural evolution (e.g.,
            Csibra &amp; Gergely, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0022" href="#"

            behavioral study in the field, how a culturally central practice of teaching has shifted with ecological
            change. More specifically, we examine, by means of video recordings, the proximal learning environment for
            the acquisition of skill in backstrap-loom weaving, the traditional skill involving the most complex female
            learning. The next sections discuss elements of the proximal learning environment that are applicable to
            weaving apprenticeship.</p>

              of economic tasks and domestic chores that contribute to family welfare are…intrinsically rewarding”
              (p.179). Coppens and Alcalá (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0019" href="#"

                    class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>) have extended this analysis, pointing out that
              children are eager to “pitch in” to contribute to family endeavors. Under these circumstances, children do
              not require extrinsic reinforcement in the form of praise. At the time our first generation learned to
              weave, weaving clothes for self and family was a crucial survival skill and therefore intrinsically
              rewarding. In line with the Whitings’ observation and the analysis of Coppens and Alcalá, there were
              extremely few instances of teacher praise for our first-generation sample of 14 learners (Childs &amp;
              Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT820268" href="#"

                    class="off-screen">Citation</span>2014</a></span>) point out that, in indigenous populations of
              Mexico and Central America, children voluntarily “pitch in” with family and household tasks. However, in
              wealthier and more highly educated Mexican families, children are more often extrinsically reinforced for
              doing chores. As the education level rose across the generations and as store-bought clothing increased,
              making weaving a less important contribution to basic subsistence, we predicted that praise, a form of
              extrinsic reinforcement, would increase as a component of the proximal learning environment for weaving
              apprenticeship.</p>
            <p>Indeed, praise is useful to recognize outstanding work or effort, important in an individualistic value
              context (Greenfield et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0034" href="#"
                  data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                    class="off-screen">Citation</span>2000</a></span>). In China, the intergenerational rise in levels
              of formal education and other features of a Gesellschaft ecology were associated with a perception that
              the current generation of mothers praised their children more than the prior two generations (Zhou et al.,
              <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                  data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>).
              We expected the same intergenerational trend toward more learner praise as the Zinacantec ecology moved in
              the Gesellschaft direction over two generations - with an increasingly commercial economy and, in
              Generation 3, much expanded formal education.
            </p>
            <p class="last">In contrast with praise, criticism functions to bring everyone up to a normative standard,
              which is functional in a collectivistic culture adapted to a Gemeinschaft environment. Indeed, at the time
              of Generation 1, critical or disparaging statements concerning a weaving learner’s skill were much more
              frequent than instances of praise. As individualistic values rose in China, in concert with increased
              education and economic development, grandmothers judged that parents of the current generation of young
              children were criticizing their children less than the previous two generations of parents (Zhou
              et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0069" href="#"
                  data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                    class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). Because of parallel social trends in Nabenchauk,
              we expected the ratio of praise to criticism to rise in weaving apprenticeship across the three
              generations in our study.</p>

            <h4 class="section-heading-4" id="d1e282">Bodily instruction</h4>
            <p>In a prior study in the same community, we demonstrated that “with respect to the body techniques of
              weaving,…there are two kinds of learners: native and non-native. The native learner is endowed from birth
              with [cultural experiences] that aid in furthering the use of various body techniques in weaving. The
              non-native learner is at a disadvantage in this realm and needs more extensive instruction in learning to
              position and use the body at each step of the process” (Maynard et al., <span
                class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0004" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                  data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>,
              p. 383). We found that cultural practices shared by Zinacantec adults and young girls, such as kneeling to
              pat tortillas or balancing a tumpline to carry wood, provided bodily skills—to the point that Zinacantec
              girls in the first two generations needed very little instruction in body techniques when learning to
              weave (Maynard et al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0004" href="#"
                  data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span

            </p>
            <p class="last">In sharp contrast, one of the authors, who had not had this prior bodily experience needed a
              lot of instruction about body technique from her Zinacantec weaving teacher—and such instruction, in the
              form of both verbalization and bodily manipulation, was spontaneously provided. In the third generation,
              the cultural practices that prepared bodies to weave at a backstrap loom had disappeared as commerce
              replaced subsistence in the economic environment. At the time the data were collected on the third
              generation, girls and women sat on chairs rather than kneeling on the ground; and charcoal stoves had
              replaced wood fires for heating and cooking. Without this bodily preparation, we thought that, like the
              author, Zincantec girls would require and receive extensive body instruction, both verbal and nonverbal.
              We also realized that girls attending school would need more help in the weaving process, particularly the
              bodily postures and movements, because, most likely, girls observed in 2012 had been too busy with school
              to learn to weave.</p>

            <p>Our ethnographic work had indicated that as money and commerce became the economic basis of the community
              and agriculture declined, children were seen as costing money rather than contributing labor. Starting
              with mothers of the second generation there was therefore interest in birth control (Greenfield, <span

              Also relevant to family size, our ethnographic observations in Nabenchauk had indicated big uptake of cell
              phones by young people, as well as by those involved in buying and/or selling vegetables and flowers in
              different communities.</p>
            <p class="last">Smaller family size and mobile technologies are related to Gesellschaft conditions that
              extend social networks beyond the family (Manago &amp; Pacheco, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a

              Fewer kin-centered social networks are related to lower birthrates (Newson et&nbsp;al., <span

              Smaller family size reduces the need for sibling caregiving and is one reason more girls, especially
              first-born daughters, are attending school (Greenfield et al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a

              that selling one’s weaving was not as profitable as engaging in other types of commercial activity. An
              important difference between learning to weave and going to school is that the former takes place at home,

              adults with action rather than words is valued. In the first generation of weaving learners, the learners
              asked no questions; instead, they focused on carrying out actions their weaving teachers suggested to them
              in the imperative mode. However, we thought that, as girls and their mothers acquired more school
              education across the generations, the influence of formal education might carry over to informal weaving
              education. The third generation was the first one in which graduating from elementary school was normative
              for girls (Maynard et al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0011" href="#"

                    class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>). Hence, question-asking during weaving
              apprenticeship was a cognitive behavior in which we thought that formal education would have a spillover
              effect on informal education, leading to an important behavioral difference between Generation 2 and
              Generation 3.</p>

          <p>We tested several hypotheses about sociodemographic shifts across the three generations. These shifts were
            thought to reflect ecological changes in the community as a whole.</p>
          <p><b>3. Girls’ schooling will increase significantly over the three generations.</b> We had already
            demonstrated an increase in schooling across the three generations in the group consisting of both boys and
            girls (Maynard, Greenfield, &amp; Childs, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0011" href="#"

                  class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>). Because completing elementary school had become
            normative for girls for the first time in Generation 3, we expected girls' schooling to be consistent with
            this overall pattern and increase across the three generations.</p>
          <p><b>4. Mothers’ schooling will increase significantly over the three generations.</b> Because many of the
            children of one generation became the parents of the next generation, we also expected mothers’ schooling to
            increase across the generations. Research by Laosa (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a

            how mothers organize children’s informal learning activities out of school. Hence, the historical increase
            in maternal schooling became a component of our integrated model, linking shifts in distal learning
            environment to the proximal learning environment of weaving apprenticeship.</p>
          <p><b>5. Family commerce will increase significantly over the three generations.</b> We predicted that family
            commerce would increase over the three generations. Because commercial activity was facilitated by an
            elementary school education that allowed bookkeeping (Greenfield et al., <span
              class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0031" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>), we
            considered commerce to work synergistically with schooling as factors that could shift the proximal learning
            environment of weaving apprenticeship.</p>
          <p><b>6. Textile commerce, which had increased from Generation 1 to Generation 2, would decrease in Generation
              3.</b> We already knew that textile commerce carried out by mothers and daughters had increased from
            Generation 1 to Generation 2. However, the foundation for all aspects of textile commerce was weaving and
            embroidering items to be sold. As schooling began to replace weaving and embroidery in the lives of
            Zinacantec girls in Nabenchauk, there was reason to believe that textile commerce would decrease in
            Generation 3.</p>
          <p><b>7. Family size will decrease over the three generations.</b> A declining birthrate would be in line with
            the concept of the demographic transition (Coale, 1989), a decrease in family size that occurs around the
            world when environments move from traditional to modern, in other words, move in the Gesellschaft direction.
            As will be seen, smaller families are an element of the distal learning environment that has implications
            for the intergenerational transmission of backstrap-loom weaving.</p>
          <p><b>8. In the third generation, mobile technologies will be used.</b> We included the use of mobile
            technology in our model of the distal learning environment, described later.</p>
          <p class="last"><b>9. Infant and child mortality will decrease over the three generations.</b> Our
            ethnographic observations indicated that residents in 2012 were making much greater use of medical
            facilities, both medical clinics and pharmacies, than had been the case for prior generations. In addition,
            purified water had become widely available in 2012 in the form of bottled water available for purchase in
            the village. Clean water had not been readily available at the time we studied Generations 1 and 2. These
            shifts were elements in the transition to a more Gesellschaft ecology.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="d1e426">Shifts in the intergenerational transmission of weaving: The
            proximal learning environment</h3>
          <p>The proximal learning environment for weaving consisted of the interactive processes shown in video
            recordings of girls learning to weave at home, i.e., the processes of weaving apprenticeship. Based on
            ethnographically observed changes in the distal learning environment, we tested the following hypotheses:
          </p>
          <p><b>10. Girls will require and receive more instruction in body postures and movements in Generation 3</b>.
            The reason for this hypothesis was the decline in Generation 3 of subsistence activities such as kneeling to
            make tortillas that provided practice in the bodily positions and movements required to weave at a backstrap
            loom (Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0008" href="#"
                data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                  class="off-screen">Citation</span>2004</a></span>). Furthermore, we hypothesized that schooling, which
            greatly reduces time available for subsistence tasks, would be related to the need for instruction in body
            postures.</p>
          <p><b>11. Praise by weaving teachers will increase across the generations, as will the ratio of praise to
              criticism.</b> As in our prior research on social change, we use the term praise to mean verbal approval
            of behavior and the term criticism to mean negative appraisals of behavior (Zhou et&nbsp;al., <span
              class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0069" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2017</a></span>). In
            our study of the first generation of weaving apprenticeship in Nabenchauk, we labeled these two concepts as
            positive and negative reinforcement (Childs &amp; Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a
                data-rid="CIT820268" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr"
                data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1980</a></span>). When an ecology moves
            from subsistence to commerce and formal education expands, as has occurred over recent generations in China,
            praise of children, a promotion strategy, is an aspect of the learning environment that increases while the
            frequency of criticism, a prevention strategy, declines (Higgins, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a
                data-rid="CIT0038" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr"

                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>).
            Because these ecological shifts have also occurred in Nabenchauk, we thought that this shift could be
            applicable to intergenerational shifts in weaving instruction in Nabenchauk—where, in the first generation,
            there had been a number of instances of criticism, but almost no instances of praise (Childs &amp;
            Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT820268" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"

          <p class="last"><b>12. Explanations by weaving teachers will increase across the generations.</b> This
            hypothesis was based on the importance of explanation in formal education, as described in the Introduction.
            It was also based on the idea and findings that the teaching techniques experienced in formal education
            transfer into informal education (Chavajay, 2006; Chavajay &amp; Rogoff, <span

          <p><b>13. Weaving expertise will decline in the current generation.</b> From Generation 1 to Generation 2,
            weaving skills and woven items expanded as textile creation became the first income-producing activity for
            Zinacantec females (Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0008" href="#"
                data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                  class="off-screen">Citation</span>2004</a></span>). However, as the commercial ecology developed
            further between Generation 2 and Generation 3, weaving became less important, while schooling, directly
            related to the language and math skills needed for commercial transactions, became more important. Because
            our weaving scale focused on subsistence items that did not require the new skills, a reasonable expectation
            was that weaving expertise would remain constant from Generation 1 to Generation 2, but decrease from
            Generation 2 to Generation 3.</p>
          <p><b>14. Because schooling would compete with weaving, we predicted an inverse relationship between weaving
              expertise and school experience.</b> In other words, girls would be weaving less because they were
            attending school more. Prior research was in line with this prediction. Indeed, in Mitontik, another Maya
            community in Highland Chiapas, universal schooling led to the almost complete disappearance of weaving
            apprenticeship (Zambrano, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0067" href="#"
                data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                  class="off-screen">Citation</span>2000</a></span>). One reason for this inverse relationship between
            home-based weaving apprenticeship and school-based formal education is that “Schooling tends to withdraw
            people from their normal life and activities and locate them in specially designed institutions” (Obidi,
            <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0056" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"

            372). With increased school experience, members of an indigenous community in Michoacan, Mexico have come to
            value physical work less and academic work more than less schooled community members of the past
            (Correa-Chávez et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0021" href="#"

          <p class="last"><b>15. We predicted an increase in a trait adaptive in school: Asking questions.</b> Asking
            questions is an important skill in maximizing school-based learning (Marx et&nbsp;al., <span

            and fewer questions are asked by students coming from a more tradition-oriented culture (e.g., Dkeidek

            cultures organized around vertical collectivism (i.e., social hierarchy), such as that of Mexican immigrants
            to the United States or people of sub-Saharan Africa, children’s questions can be seen in a negative light,

            pottery production, cross-cultural comparison within sub-Saharan Africa revealed a link between learner
            questioning, innovative designs, and commercial markets for the products (Wallaert-Pêtre, <span

            The Zinacantecs had moved away from tradition and toward innovation in their textile designs; parental
            authority had lessened as commercial activity had developed; and school-based education had increased across
            the generations (Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0008" href="#"

          <p>The study community was Nabenchauk, a Zinacantec Maya community in Highland Chiapas. The state of Chiapas,
            the most southernmost state in Mexico, is distinguished by being majority Maya. The community is connected
            to the colonial city of San Cristobal de Las Casas by the Pan American Highway. It is currently about a
            45-minute drive from Nabenchauk to San Cristobal.</p>
          <p>Participants were 134 girls and their weaving teachers (mothers, grandmothers, aunts, cousins, and sisters)
            in three generations. They came from 80 nuclear families; all had homes in Nabenchauk. In the first
            generation, studied in 1969 and 1970, Nabenchauk, population about 1500, was a mainly subsistence ecology,
            with corn grown for both home consumption and sale. Most clothing was woven by female members of the
            community. One-room houses were built by community members. In the second generation, studied in 1991 and
            1993, the economy had made a major shift toward a commercial ecology; its population had grown to about
            3,000. The advent of NAFTA on January 1, 1994 flooded Mexico with cheap corn and almost immediately
            eliminated the growing of corn, thus accelerating the transition to an economy based on money and commerce.
            By the time of the third generation, studied in 2012, formal education for indigenous children had been
            greatly expanded and families were paid on a monthly basis to keep their children in school. By 2012,
            Nabenchauk’s population had again grown, reaching about 4500 inhabitants (Maynard et al., <span

          <p>Our focus is learning how to weave on a backstrap loom. Weaving apprenticeship was carried out at home and
            was done exclusively by female members of the community. The backstrap loom and the learning context are
            shown in two photographs later in this article (<button class="ref show-table-fig-ref" data-id="F0001"
              data-behaviour="show-popup" data-popup-event-type="fig">Figure 1</button>). Our participants included 14
            girls in Generation 1, 58 girls in Generation 2, and 62 girls in Generation 3. Participants in Generations 2
            and 3 were descendants of earlier generations (typically a daughter, granddaughter, or niece of an earlier
            participant). The girls ranged in age from 3 to 22 years. The mean age across the generations was
            11.47 years; there was no significant difference in the mean age among the generations (F (2, 131) = 1.521,
            <i>p</i> = .222). The mean age in Generation 1 was 10.78; for Generation 2, mean age was 12.18 years; for
            Generation 3 mean age was 10.95 years. The first generation was studied in 1970, the second generation in
            1991 (almost all) or 1993, and the third generation in 2012. (The 1993 participants were a few girls judged
            by their mothers too young to weave in 1991.) The girls in each generation ranged from first-time weaver to
            expert.
          </p>
          <p>Weaving teachers and helpers also participated in the videotaped sessions on the backstrap loom. Helpers
            differed from teachers in that they were younger than the weaving learner and, in contrast to the teachers,
            did not know how to weave themselves. In a total of 26 cases across all three cohorts, there was no teacher
            or helper; the weaver wove independently. In 17 of these 26 cases the weaver was already an expert weaver so
            clearly did not need a teacher or helper. Weaving expertise was assessed by asking whether the girls had
            ever woven five different items of varying difficulty. An expert weaver was defined as someone who had woven
            all or most of these items, including one or two of the most difficult items (<i>pok mochebal</i> shawl,
            skirt).</p>
          <p>For the remaining 108 girls, each girl’s mother was included as a teacher in 66% of the cases. Most
            frequently the mother was the sole teacher/helper. But sometimes another member of the family, most
            frequently a teenage daughter, also participated as a teacher or helper. In 13% of the 108 cases, a teenage
            girl served as the sole weaving teacher or helper. Our findings from Generation 1 and Generation 2 indicated
            that an increase in teenage teachers in Generation 2 was associated with the creation of innovative textile
            designs (Greenfield, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0008" href="#"
                data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                  class="off-screen">Citation</span>2004</a></span>). Only in the last generation (videotaped in 2012)
            did a few grandmothers (N = 4) serve as the sole weaving teacher for their granddaughters. We think that
            this is because mothers in that generation were too busy with their commercial activities to either weave or
            help their daughters learn to weave.</p>
          <p class="last">Family tree cards made by the third author in 1969 and 1970 (and continued by all authors at
            later time points) made it possible for us to locate the descendants of earlier participants when we
            returned to the field for research in 1991, 1993, and 2012. Most were living in Nabenchauk; a few visited
            Nabenchauk on the weekends, where they still had a house and could participate in our study. All the direct
            descendants of the earlier generations who were old enough to weave agreed to participate.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="d1e547">Connecting to the community</h3>
          <p>Two of the authors started out as members of the Harvard Chiapas Project, a National Science Foundation
            funded project to give Radcliffe and Harvard students field experience in Chiapas. The project was led by
            Harvard Anthropology Department Professor, the late Evon Vogt. When Greenfield and Childs started
            collaborating on research in Nabenchauk, Childs had already participated in the Harvard Chiapas Project a
            summer earlier and spoke fluent Tzotzil. All members of the Harvard Chiapas Project were given Tzotzil
            instruction before leaving for Chiapas.</p>
          <p>A senior member of the Harvard Chiapas Project picked out our local assistant, Xun Pavlu, because he had an
            unusually large network of family and co-godparents (<i>comadres</i> and <i>compadres</i>); this
            anthropologist knew that our research required larger samples than the more ethnographic research that other
            members of the Harvard Chiapas Project were doing.</p>
          <p>When we returned to study the second generation after 21 years, Xun Pavlu again assisted us in the
            research; again his main role was participant recruitment and accompanying us to the homes where we made our
            videotapes of girls at different stages of learning to weave. This time though, because our
            intergenerational comparison required us to recruit descendants of the prior generation, we used the family
            tree cards made by the third author to direct Xun’s recruitment efforts to particular girls, descendants or
            godchildren of our original participants. Maynard joined the research in the data analysis phase after two
            generations of data had been collected; she is also a fluent Tzotzil speaker. Greenfield is less fluent, but
            can use Tzotzil for daily life. Authors Maynard, Greenfield, and Childs also speak Spanish, which was
            especially useful in the neighboring city of San Cristobal, where they each spent almost all of their
            nights. Maynard and Childs learned how to weave on a backstrap loom, which enabled them to code the video
            data of girls learning to weave.</p>
          <p class="last">By the time of our third-generation data collection in 2012, Xun Pavlu had died and one of his
            daughters-in-law, Maruch Ch’entik took over his role of participant recruitment. Maynard took the lead in
            collecting the 2012 video data of the third generation learning to weave. Our relationships with two
            extended families, who helped us beyond simply being participants, established bonds that were cemented when
            we became co-godparents. Because the limit of girls’ formal education in the community was 7<sup>th</sup>
            grade, and even that was a rare accomplishment, community members could not serve as research assistants or
            be consulted about research design in the way they would be in the United States. However, three generations
            of Xun Pavlu’s family have provided input and pilot data for all research procedures.</p>

          <h3 class="section-heading-3" id="d1e563">Procedure</h3>
          <p>We used video and interview data that we had collected in 1970 and the early 1990s for the first two
            generations. The interview data for the first two generations had already been entered into a master SPSS
            database, to which the 2012 data (see below for procedure) were added. The videos of weaving apprenticeship
            for the first two generations, plus the new videos from the third generation, were coded for the variables
            of interest in this study, as elaborated below.</p>
          <p>For the 2012 participants, we obtained informed consent from a parent and assent from minors, as approved
            by the University of Hawaìi Institutional Review Board Approval #CHS 20233 and the UCLA Institutional Review
            Board Approval #12-001084. For each generation, we videotaped a session of the girl weaving or learning to
            weave. Procedures approved by UCLA's IRB were also in place at the time the Generation 2 data were
            collected. IRBs did not exist at the time the Generation 1 data were collected.</p>
          <p>Recordings were made in the family courtyard, or occasionally in the home, if it was raining. Our local
            assistant, the late Xun Pavlu, introduced us to the families and accompanied us to almost all recording
            sessions. When setting up appointments, Xun told the prospective participants that we were interested in
            watching girls learn to weave. It was completely up to the participant and her family whether or not a
            teacher would also be involved and, if so, who the teacher would be. Video recordings of these weaving
            sessions were the source of our information about the proximal learning environment for weaving
            apprenticeship and about learner behavior in the apprenticeship process.</p>
          <p>We used recording equipment that was available in each time period. In 1970, we used the first Sony
            portable black-and-white reel-to-reel video recorder. In 1991 and 1993, we used a Sony Hi-8 color video
            recorder. In 2012, we used a Canon HD color video recorder. For the first generation, we used an external
            microphone set up under the loom. In 1991, 1993, and 2012, we used radio lavalier microphones worn by the
            weaving learner and her teacher or helper, if there was one. All sessions were recorded in Tzotzil, the
            native language of the participants and the language of the research team’s interactions with participants.
            For all cohorts, participants were given a photograph of themselves and a small payment for their time. For
            the second generation, we experimented with giving them a recording of themselves weaving; however, monetary
            payment was preferred, so monetary payment was substituted.</p>
          <p class="last">In addition to the recordings, there were several sources of detailed demographic data:
            semi-structured interviews by our research team in 1970, 1991, 1993, and 2012, and a Stanford Medical School
            survey of the community done in the summer of 1991. Participants and their mothers were interviewed about
            their sociodemographic environment, i.e., the distal learning environment, and about the participant’s
            weaving expertise. This information was integrated into the analysis.</p>

          <p>Based on the semi-structured interviews, our analysis of generational change utilized the following
            components of the distal learning environment: girls’ and mothers’ schooling, family involvement in
            commerce, textile commerce, family size, infant and child mortality, and mobile technologies. Other

              learning environment, we used interview and Stanford survey data to create a family-commerce scale and a
              textile-commerce scale. Family commerce included activities as both seller and consumer. Some examples of
              family commerce are: selling agricultural products, owning a car, and owning a number of consumer products
              ranging from small electric appliances to small refrigerators. The scale had 15 items; the score consisted
              of the percentage of commercial activities in which family members participated or items the family
              possessed.</p>
            <p>Some examples of textile commerce activities are: selling weavings, winding weaving thread for pay,
              weaving on order, embroidering on order, and selling thread. The scale had 12 items; the score consisted
              of the percentage of textile commerce activities in which mother and daughter participated. <button

            <p>Video recordings from each of the three cohorts were extensively coded by Maynard and Childs. The
              foundation of the coding system lay in the fact that community members had taught both coders backstrap
              loom
              weaving and that these two authors had not only learned to weave, but they had also watched many
              Zinacantec
              girls being taught how to weave during the video recording sessions. By the third generation, Maynard
              already knew all the families involved in the study.</p>
            <p>The basis for creating and identifying verbal codes lay in the fact that the coders were both fluent in
              the
              Maya language of Tzotzil. The limitations of formal education in the community meant that the very concept
              of coding categories would not be meaningful to our local assistants, either to expert Zinacantec weavers,
              or to weaving learners. Coding could not be done blind to the hypotheses because both qualified coders
              were
              also authors of the research, involved in collecting and/or analyzing all three waves of data collection,
              and were therefore familiar with the hypotheses.</p>
            <p class="last">All the video recordings from the first two cohorts were re-coded for our new variables of
              interest. We coded the first cycle of the weaving lesson because this cycle is difficult, providing the
              opportunity for questions, errors, and other variables of interest. By the first cycle, we mean from the
              moment of the insertion of the first bobbin until the moment of the insertion of the third bobbin. The
              first-cycle segments ranged from 0:41 − 13:29, with an average of 3:26. As our unit of analysis was the
              activity, in every case, the entire segment was coded.</p>

              <p>In the semi-structured interview, we asked about girls’ weaving experience, noting whether they had
                woven
                items of increasing difficulty including a basic small cloth, two different shawl patterns worn by girls
                and women, a skirt, and the poncho worn by boys and men. Weaving expertise was a six-point scale.
                Starting
                with 1 (no experience), the weaver received one additional point for having woven each of the five
                items.
                Girls’ weaving expertise ranged from zero to five items, with a mean of 1.69 items woven. Fifty-one
                girls
                had no prior experience and 28 of them had woven only one item, which would generally have been the
                basic
                small cloth. It is important to note that the items contain a large range of difficulty, both in pattern
                and in size. The patterns are put in at the warp-winding stage (and can be produced by a different
                weaver), so they are not relevant to weaving difficulty. However, size is a very relevant variable -
                larger items are more difficult to handle because of weight and balance issues, given that the weaver is
                part of the loom frame in backstrap-loom weaving.</p>
              <p class="last">Because of their large size, skirts would generally be the most difficult of the five
                items
                to weave. This scale was our measure of weaving expertise.</p>

                the bootstrap mediation used in this study was found to be the best of the mediation methods as well as
                the one that allowed for the smallest samples, even under 60 participants for a single mediation path
                with

                mediation used in the current study, we assumed that a larger number of participants would be necessary,
                although the addition of variables in some cases might actually increase the power without the need to
                have a larger sample (MacKinnon et&nbsp;al., 2004). Nevertheless, we thought the most prudent approach

                in
                the model. Rather than testing each of the component variables as mediators, and specifically testing
                the
                serial effect of each of the sociodemographic variables on each of the learning environment variables,

            <p>We were interested in the endpoint of schooling for most girls. Because post-primary education was very
              rare, we analyzed the schooling of girls age 13 years and up. We found that girls’ schooling went up
              significantly over the three generations: Using just participants age 13 and up (<i>F</i> (2, 55) 25.82,
              <i>p</i> &lt; .001, partial eta squared = .48, large effect size). A Games-Howell post-hoc test for
              multiple
              comparisons indicated that the difference between Generation 1 and Generation 2 was significant at less
              than
              .05, whereas the difference between Generation 2 and Generation 3 was significant at less than .001.
              Controlling for age as a covariate, schooling still went up significantly across the generations (<i>F</i>
              (3, 54) = 30.76, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, partial eta squared = .53, large effect size). The mean years of
              schooling for girls ages 13 and up were: Generation 1 (0), Generation 2 (.60), and Generation 3 (4.76). No
              girls 13 and up had ever been to school in 1970. In 1991 and 1993, the range for schooling was zero to six
              years. In 2012, the range was zero to 9.5 years. The increased range in Generation 2 indicated that some
              girls were completing elementary school, which had become functional for carrying out commercial
              activities.
              The still greater range in 2012 reflected the fact that that at least one girl had received some secondary
              education in a neighboring Zinacantec community, a possibility that had not been there one generation

              indicated that the significant increase occurred between Generation 1 and Generation 2 (<i>p = .</i>004).
              The increase between Generation 2 and Generation 3 was not statistically significant.</p>
            <p>In 1970 (Generation 1), not one mother had any schooling. In the early 1990s (Generation 2), the range
              went
              from zero to three years of school. In 2012 (Generation 3) the range of mothers’ school experience went
              from

                In 1991, PP was able to kneel correctly for a long period of time, and her mother did not give her
                instruction in how to kneel properly because such instruction was not necessary. But in 2012, PP’s
                daughter E was unable to kneel, complaining that her legs hurt, and her grandmother, PP’s mother, gave
                her
                granddaughter a number of prompts to position herself properly. We attribute the inability to kneel to
                the
                fact that PP grew up kneeling around the fire to make tortillas and carry out other activities. Small
                chairs were preferentially allocated to the males in the family. But daughter E grew up with tables and
                chairs; she lacked experience kneeling. It is known that to maintain the ability to kneel requires
                regular
                experience in kneeling growing up (Bolger, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0013"

                the 1990s and 2012, a few girls deviated and used other positions while weaving. However, this was still
                a
                minority pattern (4 out of 58 in the 1990s, 5 out of 62 in 2012). Hence, chi-square tests (Preacher,

          <p>In this age of globalization, where cultural groups are experiencing rapid changes in economics,
            demographics, and daily routines, we aimed to study links between macro-level shifts and micro-level
            learning
            interactions. Using the Zinacantec Maya community of Nabenchauk in Chiapas, Mexico, as a natural laboratory,
            we found coordinated changes over a period of more than 60 years in the distal learning environment on the
            macro-level and the proximal learning environment and learner behavior on the micro-level of weaving
            apprenticeship. Commercial activity and education expanded for both learners and teachers, mobile
            technologies
            began to be used, and family size decreased—all features of the distal learning environment. As these
            ecological shifts occurred, the proximal features of intergenerational cultural transmission also changed:
            weaving teachers praised and explained more while criticizing less, and they responded to learners’
            increased
            needs for bodily instruction by providing it. In turn, these historical shifts produced an increase in
            question-asking while learning to weave, a Gesellschaft-adapted skill valued in an educationally oriented
            society, and a decrease in weaving expertise, a Gemeinschaft-adapted skill valued in a subsistence-oriented
            community.</p>
          <p>Fewer girls were learning to weave in 2012 because they were involved in other kinds of activities,
            including
            attending school, producing on order (for pay) specialized aspects of textile creation (e.g., drawing
            patterns
            for fancy embroidery), or working with their families in other kinds of commerce (Greenfield, <span
              class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0008" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2004</a></span>;
            Greenfield et al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0031" href="#"
                data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                  class="off-screen">Citation</span>2009</a></span>). Because many girls were not learning to weave, the
            number of items girls had woven prior to our videotaped weaving lesson had decreased significantly by 2012,
            controlling for learners’ ages. This was the case even though the average age of the girls was approximately
            the same across the three generations. The decline of weaving expertise is a major phenomenon of Maya
            cultural
            evolution; this is the case because backstrap loom weaving has been the most complex technology of Maya
            culture that has survived over the millennia.</p>
          <p>Schooling competed with weaving. This finding demonstrates, on the level of individuals in a defined
            sample,
            the general anthropological conclusion that school attendance pulls children away from learning subsistence
            skills (Lancy, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0042" href="#"
                data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                  class="off-screen">Citation</span>2012</a></span>). Even
            more interesting in terms of learning processes, girls who had more schooling behaved differently in the
            weaving lesson than those with less schooling. Specifically, weaving learners who had been to school asked
            more questions as they wove in front of the video camera.</p>
          <p>Our integrated model showed that girls whose mothers had been to school also asked more questions. Asking
            questions is a form of self-assertion, a quality that is adaptive in a Gesellschaft ecology. Asking
            questions
            is, moreover, something that teachers do; and children are encouraged to do the same in school. Prior
            research
            has shown that going to school leads children to internalize the role of the teacher (Maynard, <span
              class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0005" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2002</a></span>), a
            role that includes question-asking. An important point is that the practice of asking questions in the
            context
            of formal education carried over and generalized to weaving apprenticeship, a process of informal education.
            In sum, as the evolution of community culture made backstrap-loom weaving less central, intergenerational
            transmission also evolved, reflecting cultural features that were gaining importance over time—most notably
            schooling.</p>
          <p>The topic of socialization in developmental psychology does not generally include the socialization of the
            physical body and bodily movements. Yet weaving is both a bodily skill and a cognitive skill (Maynard et
            al.,
            <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0004" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>;
            Greenfield et al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0006" href="#"
                data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                  class="off-screen">Citation</span>2003</a></span>; Maynard et al., <span

                data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>).
            Therefore, the use of the body was of great interest to us. Compared with Generations 1 and 2, girls in
            Generation 3 required more instruction in how to use their bodies in weaving. This is because kneeling, a
            long-established proper body position for Zinacantec Maya females, had diminished in favor of sitting in
            chairs, at home and at school (for those who went to school). We believe that the everyday use of chairs and
            the decrease in girls’ weaving experience are factors in the need for body instruction. Our case study of AE
            showed that body position could not be taken for granted by girls who went to school and had no experience
            in
            everyday life of kneeling to carry out various activities.
          </p>
          <p>We have traced how the shift at the ecological level from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft engendered
            intergenerational changes in the learning environment, in turn shifting learner behavior in each generation.
            This cross-cohort comparative design has demonstrated how cultural evolution can be directly observed and
            assessed on multiple levels across multiple generations. Our findings provide an empirical demonstration of
            nested levels of environmental influence very much in the spirit of Bronfenbrenner’s (<span
              class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0014" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"

            Ecological Systems Theory.</p>
          <p>But our research also documents that these multilevel changes come at a cultural&nbsp;cost - the gradual
            loss
            of weaving as an everyday subsistence practice and art form. In this too, the village is a microcosm of
            Mexico
            and the globalizing world.</p>

            <p>These shifts in the macro-environment in the Gesellschaft direction are happening on a global level. Many
              societies and communities beyond our study site have moved in recent generations from agriculture and
              subsistence lifestyles to commerce, formal education, and technology (e.g., Abu Aleon et&nbsp;al., <span
                class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0001" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"

                  data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2015</a></span>).
              In
              addition, migrants all over the world are moving from communities based on agricultural and subsistence
              lifestyles to host societies that have highly developed commercial, educational, and technological
              ecologies
              (e.g., Greenfield et al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0035" href="#"
                  data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                    class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). Therefore, our longitudinal findings in
              Nabenchauk
              are applicable to shifts in learning environment and cognitive development brought about by endogenous
              social change and migration all over the world. The traditional view in developmental psychology that
              cultural differences are static does not take into account the fact that the influences on learning
              undergo
              massive change over time, making learning and cognitive development dynamic processes, and producing
              altered
              patterns of cognitive development (Maynard et al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a
                  data-rid="CIT0011" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr"

            </p>
            <p>As Zinacantec girls over time asked more questions as they and their mothers were exposed to more formal
              education, their behavior became more like the children teachers expect to teach in the U.S. or Western
              Europe. This finding illustrates another broader implication of the present research: the global direction
              of social change in the Gesellschaft direction often has the effect of reducing cultural differences in
              child development (e.g., Zhou et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0069"
                  href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                    class="off-screen">Citation</span>2018</a></span>).</p>
            <p>However, lest we mistakenly view the emerging patterns of development as progress, we need to remember
              the
              cultural losses from movement away from a Gemeinschaft ecology. On the physical level, we have documented
              loss of the ability to kneel as the human-made environment has changed. In Chiapas, Mexico, weaving as a
              cultural practice is a loss in Maya communities across the state resulting from the increase in
              educational
              opportunity (Zambrano, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0067" href="#"
                  data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                    class="off-screen">Citation</span>2000</a></span>). Such losses are also applicable to communities
              in
              other countries moving from subsistence life styles to life in Gesellschaft environments. For example,
              with
              immigration to Israel, Ethiopian immigrants now value formal education and technology, but devalue their
              artistic practice of clay sculpture, originally a subsistence practice in their ancestral country of
              Ethiopia (Greenfield et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0035" href="#"
                  data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                    class="off-screen">Citation</span>2019</a></span>). While we need to understand that there are
              developmental losses as well as gains from ecological movement in the Gesellschaft direction, we also need
              to remember that each set of cultural practices is adapted to a different set of ecological circumstances.

              <p>It would be interesting to know if delayed childbearing was a factor in producing smaller families.
                Because we have not calculated each mother’s age when she bore her first child, we do not know if this
                was
                a factor in family size. We will be able to assess this factor in the future. Undoubtedly, some mothers
                continued to have children after the study; and these could not be counted in our assessment of family
                size. This is a limitation on our accuracy in reporting family size, but it is a constant across the
                generations, so does not affect our statistical comparison across the three generations.</p>
              <p class="last">Another limitation of the present study is that the coders of the videos were not blind to
                all hypotheses, particularly because we had published articles together based on the first and second
                generations. However, the coding system was rather rigid (how many seconds of this, what grammatical
                structure of that sentence, positive or negative statements). It would be hard to alter the coding
                systematically to fit a hypothesis. Furthermore, we achieved strong to perfect reliability on the coding
                of a random set of videos, which also adds to credibility. It would have been impossible to find coders
                who could weave, speak Tzotzil, and had enough formal education to understand the coding process in
                order
                to achieve blind coding.</p>

                development</h4>
              <p>Children’s questions have commonly been seen as a part of cognitive development that is essential to
                learning in formal and informal learning environments (Chouinard et&nbsp;al., <span
                  class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0017" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                    data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>;
                Haber et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0036" href="#"
                    data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                      class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>). Inquiry-based learning, which, as the name
                implies, centers on raising questions, specifically from learners, is often seen as the gold-standard of
                educational practice (Geier et&nbsp;al., <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0030"
                    href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                      class="off-screen">Citation</span>2008</a></span>; Nicolopoulou et&nbsp;al., <span
                  class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0055" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                    data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                      class="off-screen">Citation</span>2021</a></span>).
                However, much educational practice and developmental research treats children’s question-asking and the
                types of questions they tend to ask as if it were a natural process rather than the product of
                adaptation
                to different learning environments. Many educators give a nod to sociocultural practices, seeing
                schooling
                and instructional methods as sociocultural practices, but still expecting that children naturally ask
                questions in the way they, the educators, do. Our research indicates that children’s questionasking is
                not
                natural but culturally specific, an adaptation to the learning environments and cognitive development of
                Gesellschaft social ecologies (Jegede &amp; Olajide, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a
                    data-rid="CIT0039" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr"
                    data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1995</a></span>). The current
                research
                indeed found that the latest generation of weavers asked more questions of their teachers in the course
                of
                learning, which, we argue, is indicative of the change in the social ecology from the earlier
                generations
                toward more Gesellschaft-adapted learning environments and a subsequent shift toward
                Gesellschaft-adapted
                cognitive development.</p>
              <p>These findings are very applicable for teachers. Many children in the United States and Europe come
                from
                immigrant families in which parents are from rural more Gemeinschaft environments than the environment
                of
                their host country. In such communities, questions can be considered a mark of disrespect; agricultural
                workers in California from Mexico or Central America provide an example of this cultural interpretation
                (Delgado-Gaitan, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0023" href="#"
                    data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span
                      class="off-screen">Citation</span>1994</a></span>). Children from such environments are socialized
                to show respect to parents and teachers by NOT asking questions.</p>
              <p>What teachers can take away from this analysis and our findings is that children brought up in this way
                may not engage in the question-asking valued in school. When children have experienced this type of
                cultural socialization, teachers can learn from our research to treat the absence of children’s
                questions
                as a cultural trait rather than a cognitive deficit. However, because questions are valued in the host
                culture, teachers can also be explicit about the difference between home and school cultures and, early
                in
                their education, gently guide children toward the question-asking so important and valued in formal
                education.</p>
              <p>In addition to environmental influences on the presence vs. absence of learner questions, there are
                also
                ecological factors in the types of questions that are relevant and valued. Much of the research
                regarding
                children’s questions, at least with U.S. samples, highlights different types of questions than the ones
                the most recent generation of weaving learners were asking. For instance, Chouinard et&nbsp;al. (<span
                  class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0017" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref"
                    data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2007</a></span>)
                report that preschool children’s questions tend to be fact or causal explanation seeking. The Zinacantec
                weaving learners' questions concerned learning the procedure. We argue that the differences in the types
                of questions students ask in the weaving environment or in formal schooling are not just a matter of age
                difference, but also reflect the different goals of the two learning environments. So, children in
                school
                might not be asking about procedures, because theoretical knowledge and not procedures are the center of
                schooling; insofar as procedures are involved—such as in science class labs—these are not done for their
                own sake but in the service of theoretical learning. This contrasts with the tasks of teaching and
                learning to weave. But that different types of environment entail very different tasks is precisely the
                point. Teaching and learning, and children’s cognitive developmental tasks are adapted to the learning
                environment.</p>
              <p>Direct application to classroom teaching is also possible. Author Childs, who teaches sixth graders in
                the U.S., has applied our research in a very concrete way to teach about cultural relativity, more
                specifically, to teach students that children are taught differently in different ecological
                circumstances. She sets up a backstrap loom in a classroom, demonstrates how weaving is done, and then
                asks a student to get into the loom. She then provides a demonstration of teaching as it was done in our
                first generation of weaving learners: criticism rather than praise; imperatives rather than questions;
                observation rather than doing; replication rather than innovation. She also explains that in such an
                environment, education takes place primarily at home rather than at school. She points out that these
                are
                teaching and learning procedures they have probably never even imagined exist. While many of the
                students
                find Childs' demonstration quite alien, a number of them come to understand something about profound
                cultural differences; hence the demonstration functions as a lesson in cultural relativity.</p>
              <p class="last">Childs also points out to her students that, as Zinacantec Maya environments have become
                more like ours, most recently with increased opportunities for formal education, teaching and learning
                procedures have also become more like ours. She uses her example of backstrap-loom weaving in Nabenchauk
                to teach that modes of teaching and learning are adapted to particular environments and that they
                therefore change as environments shift over time. This innovative application of the research is a
                concrete, valuable example of using it in an educational setting.</p>

        Evolution is where we delve into history with a focus on typographical and color aesthetics. Our articles are
        crafted with two distinct themes: the Historical Theme, reflecting typographical styles from the 16th to the
        19th centuries, and the Antique Theme, which embraces the transition from early 20th-century print aesthetics to
        modern color schemes.

        As you explore our content, you'll notice subtle typographical changes and color palettes inspired by each
        theme. The metadata integrated throughout our articles further enhances the visual experience, highlighting key
        elements and providing context.

        Please note that the sample websites referenced serve as resources to illustrate the evolution of typographical
        and color trends. Their inclusion does not imply endorsement or affiliation.

        Thank you for joining us on this journey through history, where typography and color bring the past to life in
        vibrant detail.
